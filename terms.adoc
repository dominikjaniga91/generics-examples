Generic type :: A Generic type is a class or interface that is parametrized over types. A class or interface declaration that is generic
                defines a set of parameterized types.

Generic method :: This is a method that introduce their own type parameter. Type parameter's scope is limited to rhe method where is is declared.
                  It is allowed to declare generic method in generic class as well as in ordinary classes.

Diamond operator :: It is an informal name of empty pair of angle brackets that replace the type argument required to invoke generic class constructor.
                    The Java compiler can determine, or infer, the type arguments from the context. We can use diamond since Java 7.

Type parameter :: According to Java Language Specification 15, it is unqualified identifier that is used as a type in class,
                  interface, methods and constructor bodies. In other words, it is a symbol provided between angle brackets after generic type’s name.
                  By convention, type parameter names are single, uppercase letters. The most commonly used type parameter names are: T - type, K - key
                  E - element (used extensively by the JCF), N - number, S, U, V etc. - 2nd, 3rd, 4th types.

Parameterized type :: A parameterized type is an instantiation of a generic type with actual type arguments.

Raw type :: It is an instance of generic type without actual type parameter.
            Raw types behave as if all of the generic type information were erased from the type declaration.
            When using raw types, we essentially get pre-generics behavior, we lose all the safety and expressiveness benefits of generics.
            For backward compatibility, assigning a parameterized type to its raw type is allowed.
            There is one minor exception when it comes to raw type - you must use raw types in class literal, for instance List.class.
            The following code is not valid - List<String>.class.


Type erasure :: According to JLS 4.6 the type erasure is a mapping from types (possibly including parameterized types and
                type variables) to types (that are never parameterized types or type variables). In other words it is a process
                that maps a parameterized type (or method) to its unique byte code representation by eliding type parameters and arguments.

Bounded type parameters :: It is a type parameter with bound. In other words it is a restriction for type parameter.
                            The syntax looks like this: class MyClass<T extends A & B & C>. We need to remember that class in java can e
                            xtend only one class and implements many interfaces, and class must be the firs bound.
                            In this example A can be a class or interface, B and C must be the interfaces.


Type inference :: It is a Java compiler’s ability to look at each method invocation and corresponding declaration to
                  determine the type argument that make the invocation applicable. UtilClazz.<Integer>compare(p1, p2) - in this example
                  the type argument can be omitted and a Java compiler automatically infers that the type parameter is Integer.
                  You can also replace the type arguments required to invoke the constructor of a generic class with an empty pair of angle brackets.

Target typing :: is the process that infer the type parameters of a generic method invocation. The target type of an expression is the data
                 type that the Java compiler expects depending on where the expression appears.

Wildcards :: Wildcard is a question mark (?) that represent an unknown type. For instance List<?> is called a list of unknown type.
             Can be used as the type of a parameter, field, or local variable. We can use wild card also as a return type. We cannot use
             wildcard as a type argument for a generic method invocation, a generic class instance creation, or a supertype.

Bounded wildcards :: Is a question mark (?) that represent an unknown type with some restriction. We can specify lower-bounded
                    and upper-bounded wildcard. A lower-bounded wildcard is restricted to specific type of a super type.
                    A lower bounded wildcard is expressed using the wildcard character ('?'), following by the super keyword,
                    followed by its lower bound: <? super A>. To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character ('?'),
                    followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound. In this context "extends" keyword is used for extend class and implement interface.

Unbounded wildcards :: It is a wildcard without any restriction. We can use unbounded wildcard in two scenarios.

Erasure of generic types :: Is it a process in which java compiler will replace type parameter with its first bound or
                            Object if type parameter is unbounded. For instance <T> will be replaced with Object, <T extends Number> will be replaced with Number.
                            Produced bytecode will contains only ordinary classes, interfaces and methods.
                            In type erasure java compiler also insert type casts if necessary to preserve type safety. Whenever you use a generic methods or access
                            the generic field the casting occurs. When type parameter has more bounds, then java compiler also insert cast to the
                            second bound if necessary. The java compiler also generates the bridge method to preserve polymorphism in extended generic types.
                            Erasure is what allowed generic types to interoperate freely with legacy code that did not use generics.

Generic methods :: This is a method that introduce their own type parameter. Type parameter's scope is limited to rhe method where is is declared.
                   It is allowed to declare generic method in generic class as well as in ordinary classes.

Bridge methods :: Bridge method is a synthetic methods that java compiler generates to preserve polymorphism when class or interface
                  extends a another generic class or implements generic interface. Type erasure changes the signature of the superclass's methods.
                  The subclass's methods are no longer overriding versions of the superclass's method after type erasure.
                  In order to make overriding work the compiler adds bridge methods. The compiler must add bridge methods even if the subclass
                  does not override the inherited methods.

Non-reifiable types :: It is a type whose type information is not fully available at runtime.
                       In other words this is a type whose runtime representation has less information than compile-time representation.
                       Examples of non-reifiable types are List<String> and List<Number>. The opposite of non-reifiable types are reifiable types.
                       Reifiable type is a reifiable type is a type whose type information is fully available at runtime.
                       This includes primitives, non-generic types, raw types, and invocations of unbound wildcards.


@SafeVarargs :: It is annotation use to mark generic method that take varargs as parameter. When you mix generics and
                varargs the java compiler will display a warning about possibly heap pollution. This is because varargs under the hood is
                an ordinary array, and we cannot create an instance of array of type parameter like new E[]. However varargs is very useful
                so the Java designers opt to live with this inconsistency.
