== Generify this

[source, java]
----
// 1

List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("hello");
String s = (String) list.get(0);

// 2

class Box {
    private Object object;

    void set(Object object) { this.object = object; }
    Object get() { return object; }
}

// 3

class Pair {
    private Object first;
    private Object second;

    void set(Object o1, Object o2) {
        this.first = o1;
        this.second = o2;
    }

    Object getFirst() { return first; }
    Object getSecond() { return second; }
}
----

== Code a generic method

[source, java]
----
// printMe method for arrays of Integers, Characters, People and Grades
//      People - plural for Person, has a list of Person inside
//      Grades - plural for Grade, has a list of Grade inside
//      Person - has a name, surname, dateOfBirth (of type LocaDate), unique ID and perhaps methods that every object has
//      Grade - has a title, dateOfIssuance (of type LocaDate), unique ID and perhaps methods that every object has
//      overloading is NOT allowed, remember! Only! One! Method! Enhanced for loop is welcome.


// max method for three arguments of same type
//      types can be Strings, Characters, Integers, People, Grades
//      so "apples", "booze", "cheddar"
//      'k', 'v', 'e'
//      5, -13, 0
//      new Person(...), new Person(...), new Person(...)
//      new Grade(...), new Grade(...), new Grade(...)
//      
//      Method MUST use generic type tied to the Comparable interface as a return type.


// mapCreator method for two arguments of a DIFFERENT type
//      method returns a map with first type being key type and second being value type
//      returned map should be a singleton map - a map with one pair

== Explain terms

Fill in the blanks please, in the terms.adoc file

== Demonstrate

For each point here, demonstrate it in a separate class:

. Cannot Instantiate Generic Types with Primitive Types
. Cannot Create Instances of Type Parameters
. Cannot Declare Static Fields Whose Types are Type Parameters
. Cannot Use Casts or instanceof With Parameterized Types
. Cannot Create Arrays of Parameterized Types
. Cannot Create, Catch, or Throw Objects of Parameterized Types
. Cannot Overload a Method Where the Formal Parameter Types of Each Overload Erase to the Same Raw Type
